        Custom signature authentication.
        Generate the encrypted signature string by combining the following request header parameters:
        SignatureNonce, Version, AccessKeyId, Timestamp,
        and the fixed parameters SignatureVersion (fixed: 1.0), Format (fixed: JSON),
        and SignatureMethod (fixed: HMAC-SHA1).
        Signature Generation Process:
        1. URL-encode all request parameters.
        2. Sort the parameters lexicographically by their keys.
        3. Concatenate the sorted key-value pairs into a single string.
        4. Prepare the signature string, which includes the HTTP method and the URL-encoded parameter string, in the format: POST&%2F&<encoded_parameters>.
        5. Sign the string using the user’s secret key and the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm.
        6. Encode the resulting signature using Base64.
        Signature Verification Process:
        1. Receive the API request, including the request parameters and the Base64-encoded signature(header:Signature).
        2. Regenerate the signature using the same steps as in the signature generation process.
        3. Compare the received signature with the regenerated signature.
        4. If the two signatures match, the verification passes, indicating that the request is intact and from a trusted source.
        5. If the signatures do not match, the verification fails, suggesting that the request may have been tampered with or an error occurred during transmission.
