  title: Network Traffic Analysis
  description: |
    Network Insight offers a unified analytical platform for specific networks, such as private networks and slices, focusing exclusively on aggregated network-level data rather than individual device information.
    It empowers users to both evaluate the overall network health through a comprehensive, component-based scoring system and to analyze service traffic patterns with customizable granularity.
    By providing a holistic view — from infrastructure health to user traffic trends — this API suite delivers the critical, real-time data needed for comprehensive network monitoring, strategic performance optimization, and effective early warning systems.

    # Introduction

    the Network Traffic Analysis API utilizes DPI collection technology to capture communication traffic between all services or terminals within the network.
    By correlating service-specific data with devices and port resources, it aggregates and calculates the traffic flow for each service, thereby deriving service-based traffic distribution across the entire network.
    This data helps identify high-traffic services and traffic load conditions during different time periods, facilitating the provision of appropriate bandwidth for critical services through slicing technology, ultimately enabling efficient utilization of network resources.

    # API functionality

    The API provides the following functionality:
    - It allows users to directly query access traffic statistics for all services within a specified time period, including the number of accesses and the cumulative values of uplink and downlink traffic.

    # Request Parameters Definition:
    * **startTime**: Start time for the analysis in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'.
    * **endTime**: End time for the analysis in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'.
    * **Domain ID (optional)**: The platform defines the unique identifier for the service.
    * **period**: Period for the analysis ('DAY', 'HOUR', etc.).
    * **page**: Page number for pagination (optional).
    * **pageSize**: Number of records per page for pagination (optional).

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    This API requires users to provide user information via request header signature authentication. By using the AccessKeyId (user account), SignatureNonce (random unique identifier), Version (date identifier), Timestamp (timestamp), and Signature (calculated from other request headers using an encryption algorithm) fields in the request headers, the API verifies the Signature. Upon verification, the API accepts the value in AccessKeyId as the user identity to match user data.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

        Custom signature authentication.
        Generate the encrypted signature string by combining the following request header parameters:
        SignatureNonce, Version, AccessKeyId, Timestamp,
        and the fixed parameters SignatureVersion (fixed: 1.0), Format (fixed: JSON),
        and SignatureMethod (fixed: HMAC-SHA1).
        Signature Generation Process:
        1. URL-encode all request parameters.
        2. Sort the parameters lexicographically by their keys.
        3. Concatenate the sorted key-value pairs into a single string.
        4. Prepare the signature string, which includes the HTTP method and the URL-encoded parameter string, in the format: POST&%2F&<encoded_parameters>.
        5. Sign the string using the user’s secret key and the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm.
        6. Encode the resulting signature using Base64.
        Signature Verification Process:
        1. Receive the API request, including the request parameters and the Base64-encoded signature(header:Signature).
        2. Regenerate the signature using the same steps as in the signature generation process.
        3. Compare the received signature with the regenerated signature.
        4. If the two signatures match, the verification passes, indicating that the request is intact and from a trusted source.
        5. If the signatures do not match, the verification fails, suggesting that the request may have been tampered with or an error occurred during transmission.
