# Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) API User Story

| **Field** | Description | 
| ---- | ----- |
| API family name | Network Insights API |
| API summary | **Overview**: For private network monitoring, general users cannot intuitively perceive network performance status or identify performance bottlenecks and faults from complex metrics. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and integrate raw network and device performance data to achieve monitoring of the entire private network’s status from a higher level.  <br /> **Correlation with network-insight API**: The Network Insights API collects, analyzes, and visualizes network-related data, applying deep analysis and insights to enable private network users to understand what is happening on the network, identify potential issues, and make smarter decisions. Specifically, the Network Health Assessment API is based on a pre-configured service monitoring model (which allows for the selection of modules such as RAN, transport network, and core network, according to service conditions, and sets scoring rules, weights, and severe degradation thresholds for their key alarms and performance indicators to generate a health monitoring model). It performs comprehensive calculations to provide composite score data for each module and the entire private network, presenting private network users with an immediate and intuitive view of the business network status. Additionally, it allows for the retrieval of historical scores, prediction of future network performance trends, and the identification of network bottlenecks and fault location.<br/> **Network Health Assignment API**: It allows users to directly query the latest health assessment score. Based on the health model, this may include scores for modules such as terminals, RAN, transport network, core network, and MEC, as well as a comprehensive score for all modules.<br /><br /> Proposed API Definitions <br /> -Input Parameters:<br />structCode: module of Network (net, net_wireless, net_transnet, net_corer)<br /><br /> -Output Parameters:<br />time: The time of the score create. <br />valid: The validity of the score. <br />value: The score of the health. <br /> <br /> An example: Health assessment relies on performance and alarm data from devices such as terminals, wireless base stations, and core network elements within the private network. The entire data management process can follow the steps below.<br />Resource Management: The computing platform needs to maintain information on all device assets within the private network and know which devices are included.<br />Performance and Alarm Collection: The computing platform can complete data collection via the device network management platform or by connecting directly to the devices.<br />Health Assessment Model Generation: Based on the nature of the private network service, indicators for terminals, base stations, or core network elements can be custom selected, and scoring rules can be set for these indicators.<br />Health Assessment Result Generation: Based on the collected data and the calculation model, health assessment score records are generated periodically.<br />Health Assessment Result Query: Private network users can query results for the most recent time point at any time.|
| Technical viability | This API requires the completion of device performance and alarm data collection. If collecting via a device management system, the collection protocol can be negotiated independently; if connecting directly to the device, collection via the SNMP protocol can be considered. Regarding the design of the health assessment calculation model, the key is to identify the indicators that best reflect performance and fault status across modules such as terminals, RAN, and core network. Then, based on the private network service type, set the weight and threshold for each indicator, and configure the source of the comparison value (period-over-period, year-over-year, or comparison against a fixed value).|
| Commercial viability | Health assessment is intended for organizations and individuals who need to monitor the status of their private network. It typically serves as a foundational feature for the monitoring dashboards of operators’ private network management platforms, and interfaces can also be opened up for private network users or third-party managed platforms to call for secondary development.| 

## ***Summary***

General private network users typically lack professional O&M capabilities and are unable to determine the actual operating status of the private network by directly inspecting devices or interpreting complex metric data provided by management platforms. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a series of higher-level visualization functions to facilitate self-management and self-operations for private network users. <br /> The Network Health Assessment API provides such capabilities for monitoring personnel, enabling them to perform private network health self-checks based on a preconfigured health assessment calculation model.
